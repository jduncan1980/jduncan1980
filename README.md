### Hi! My name is Jason Duncan, I am a Web developer from Brooklyn, NY, and I was just certified in the Web Development and Computer Science track at Lambda School. I'm just finished working on an App called CitySpire which allows user's to retrieve city data (rents, livability index, etc) from a curated list of US Cities, and compare said data. I am also in the process of looking for my first tech job!
